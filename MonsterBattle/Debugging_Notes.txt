volc is fire/bug, skarmory is steel/flying

volcarona uses fiery dance on skarmory
fire type attack on a steel and flying type pokemon
fire is 2x against steel defense and 1x against flying defense



Things to test:
Does doing a super effective move on a poke with one type do 4x damage (which it shouldn't)?

Add functionality for:
DONE - Moves that do a fixed amount of damage as an attribute for "Moves" (e.g. dragon breath, night shade etc.)
DONE - Remove hardcoded names in menu and refactor variable names
DONE - Add stat modifiers to the menu
DONE - Setting moveset to a list of object "Moves" which is a field of the Pokemon class
DONE - Incorporate functionality for moves that have a chance of increasing a stat
DONE - Including the stat modifier stage system from +6 to -6 and the stat change for each stage https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Statistic#Stage_multipliers
DONE - Remove the hardcoded stat increase and modify it for a general stat change
ONGOING - PP actually decreasing after each use of a move, and having pp be shown for each move on screen

- Have CPU pick a random attack to use (can add more complex functionality later)
- Accuracy and evasion for both moves and for the pokemon themselves
- Moves that have a chance at increasing more than one stat (can do this by setting the variables that will change as a list
- Moves that hit multiple times e.g. bullet seed, power punch etc.
- Moves with priority e.g. quick attack
- User picks the moves they want from a selection of available moves for a particular pokemon e.g. All moves are shown with an accompanying
number, with the user picking one number at a time until 4 have been picked. If a number is chosen that's already been picked, then the user is notified
- Remove hardcoded message for the move fly
